## Weather Application
Test task for iOS Developer position at STRV - Weather application.

<b>My first application written in Swift.</b>

####Task
Create a simple iOS app for weather forecasting. The app should support iOS version 9 and newer. The project must be possible to compile with Swift 3.0 and in the last production version of XCode. It basically shows actual weather for your location. In the Forecast tab show the forecast for next 7 days at current location.

Use:
- Auto Layout and make the layout responsive for all screen sizes your app supports - we require at least full iPhone support.
- CocoaPods and Swift (do not use Objective C anymore). 
- Open Weather Map API (http://openweathermap.org/api). 
- Geolocation for determining current position of the device. 
- Firebase SDK (https://www.firebase.com/). Use Firebase for simple storing current position and its temperature when this is available (For now, think only of storing the data).

Make sure you consider and handle all possible states of the app (offline, data not loading, errors etc).

All graphic elements and assets are located in "Description" folder as this document.

####Notes
Serious problems (ignored - this app is for me only for education of Swift and RxSwift):
- App doesn't contain Firebase SDK.
- There is lot of missing images in resources from STRV.
- There is lot of differences between screenshots and API content.

####Posible improvements
- Landscape mode of app.
- Complete Forecast section.
- Test Observable.mapLocationToCityName extension
